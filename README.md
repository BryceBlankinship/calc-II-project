Calc II Project to calculate integrals using midpoint, trapezoid, and simpson methods.

Written in Javascript using React.js library and Vite.js build tooling, backed by an Express.js server provided via vite-express plugin by @szymmis on Github (Shoutout to him he is very active on his project).

Live submissions provided using websockets and persisted in-memory using SQLite.

There is an Easter Egg, see if you can find it! (Will be pretty easy if you just read the code).
